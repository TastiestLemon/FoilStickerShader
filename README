A simple foil sticker effect made for a game I'm working on.
Anyone's welcome to use it because gods I would do anything to see foil stickers in more games >:3

NOTE:
The "offset" variable is tied to time, which worked better for my use case, though if you want a more realistic shimmer,
it may be worth tying offset to the angle at which you're looking at the sticker- as well as the distance you are from it
